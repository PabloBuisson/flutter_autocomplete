# FLUTTER AUTOCOMPLETE

A list of possibilities when it comes to add **autocomplete functionality** to your Flutter application

## :rocket: Goals of the project

* Try and provide examples of the **Autocomplete widget** *(added in Flutter 2.0)*
* Try and provide examples of the **TypeAhead** package
* Use the new way of displaying **SnackBar** *(added in Flutter 2.0)*
* Be comfortable with the **Null Safety** *(added in Flutter 2.0)*
* Use the **TabBar** layout

## :dart: Presentation of the project

* In this simple demo, I explore **3 ways of adding the autocomplete functionnality** to a Flutter application :   
   * With the autocomplete native widget showing suggestions of a local list of items (*synchronous autocompletion*)
   * With the autocomplete native widget showing suggestions of an API (*asynchronous autocompletion*)
   * With the most popular autocomplete package showing suggestions of an API (*flutter_typeahead, asynchronous autocompletion*)
